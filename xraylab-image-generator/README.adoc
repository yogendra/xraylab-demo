= Image generator container

This container image is used to randomly select *normal* (80%) and *pneumonia risk* (20%) images from a *source* bucket, and copy them to a *destination* bucket.
A small mysql-compatible database instance is used to keep track of the images uploaded.

Required environment variables are: +
*Object storage*

* `access_key`: S3 storage access key
* `secret_key`: S3 storage secret key
* `service_point`: S3 storage endpoint, http(s)://myendpoint.address

*Buckets*

* `bucket_source`: name of the source bucket
* `bucket_destination`: name of the destination bucket

*Helper database*

* `db_user`: database user name
* `db_password`: database password
* `db_host`: database host
* `db_db`: database name

*Delay between images*

* `seconds_wait`: number of seconds to wait between each image. This can be less than 1 second, e.g. `0.2`
